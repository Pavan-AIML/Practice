# Object-detection 👁️
## Here we will learn about the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms with technical in-depth details of the model architecture.

### The following algorithms/steps will be part of the project 🚀 🚀

- IoU (Intersection over Union) computing.
- Computing image gradients.
- Filling the Histogram of oriented gradient (HOG ) bins.
- Sliding window detection.
- Nonmaximum impression calculation.
